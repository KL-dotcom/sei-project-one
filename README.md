# Kitty Food Dash

## Brief

Kitty Food Dash is based off of the classic arcade game Frogger. The game comprises of navigating Sammy the kitty across a game board filled with enemies, in order to get him to the foodbowls on the other side. There are two levels, each with their own styling and game play.

## Timeframe

This project was completed in 8 days.

## Technologies Used

JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Key learnings

What I took away from the project is the importance of organisation in code. I left a lot of refactoring until the last minute, and it would have been better to refactor during coding.

This project solidified my understanding of classes and class constructors in JavaScript.

I learned a log about stacking classes in CSS and using the cascade to my advantage.

## Challenges and future improvements

A big challenge was the movement of the enemies on the board. I used Date Now in order to pace out the movements, however this caused a "walking" type of effect with the enemies. This was solved by taking Date Now out of the functions and into the main game loop.

I would like to improve the visuals of the game, as styling is basic at the moment.

I would also like to go through and neaten up the code and naming conventions.
